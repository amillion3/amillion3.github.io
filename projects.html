                    <h4>Elephant</h4>
                    <p>Wow. Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleazebag. I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. I never smile if I can help it, Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. Someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.</p>

                    <p>Dwight you ignorant slut. Sometimes you just have to be the boss of dancing. Saddle shoes with denim? I will literally call Protective Services. I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY! In an ideal world I would have all ten fingers on my left hand and the right one would just be left for punching.</p>

                    <p>Crazy world. Lotta smells. I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs. DID I STUTTER?</p>

                    <p>What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went -- I once went 28 years without having sex. And then again for seven years. I don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me. I just want regular fries. Oh God, my mind is going a mile an hour.</p>

                    <p>If I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice. Just pretend like we're talking until the cops leave. Dwight you ignorant slut. I love catching people in the act. That's why I always whip open doors.</p>

                    <h4>Fox</h4>
                    <p>There is no such thing as an appropriate joke, that's why it's a joke. You couldn't handle my undivided attention. Every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican. I feel God in this Chili's. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.</p>
