The user can also filter by the time of day my ex usually frequents those locations. Using jQuery over vanilla JavaScript, the functionality is basic, but important.",

However, the calculator is not smart enough to factor in order of operations.",

This app allows a user to enter in a movie budget and then add different movie elements to their movie. Each movie element costs a certain amount of money. If the user goes over budget, they cannot make the movie. If the user does not include one movie element from each category, they cannot make the movie. Styling was kept fairly simple on this app, the focus was on functionality.",
