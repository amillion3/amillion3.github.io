Citizens can login to the app and add potholes in need of repair using a map interface. When adding potholes, users can specify how severe the pothole is (low, medium, high) and add additional details for government officials.",

If the user goes over budget, they cannot make the movie. If the user does not include one movie element from each category, they cannot make the movie. Styling was kept fairly simple on this app, the focus was on functionality.",
